Spring Boot Stack

Overview:
Spring Boot simplifies building Java backend services and is often paired with either server-side templates or a separate JS frontend.
- Frontend: Thymeleaf (server-side) or React/Vue/Angular (SPA)
- Backend: Spring Boot (Java / Kotlin)
- Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL (or other relational DBs)

Frontend (Thymeleaf or SPA):
Thymeleaf integrates with Spring MVC for server-side rendering. Alternatively, teams use React/Angular as a separate client that consumes Spring REST or GraphQL APIs.

Backend (Spring Boot):
Spring Boot provides rapid setup for Spring-based applications (REST endpoints, security with Spring Security, data with Spring Data JPA, dependency injection). It is production-grade and widely used in enterprise systems.

Database (Postgres/MySQL):
Spring Data JPA + Hibernate is commonly used to interact with relational databases (PostgreSQL/MySQL). Migrations via Flyway or Liquibase are standard.

Typical flow:
Frontend (client) → HTTPS → Spring Boot API → PostgreSQL/MySQL

MERN Stack

Overview:
The MERN stack is a JavaScript-centric web stack composed of:
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB

Frontend (React):
React provides a component-based UI library for building interactive single-page applications (SPAs). It handles client-side routing (with libraries like React Router), state management (Context, Redux, Zustand, etc.), and UI rendering.

Backend (Node.js + Express):
Node.js runs JavaScript on the server; Express is a minimal web framework for building REST or GraphQL APIs. Typical responsibilities: routing, middleware, authentication, validation, and connecting to the database.

Database (MongoDB):
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database storing JSON-like documents (BSON). It scales horizontally and maps naturally to JavaScript objects used by Node.js. Commonly used ODM: Mongoose.

Typical flow:
React (client) → HTTP/HTTPS → Express API → MongoDB
